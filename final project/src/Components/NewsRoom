            <h2>Experts discuss: Is AI the Future of Mental Health Care?</h2>
            <p>We are revolutionising how we deliver mental health care in order to address the enormous unmet need that exists in Australia.

                On 31 May, University of Melbourne and industry experts came together to share their insights with the alumni community on how AI technology could provide tangible and sustainable solutions in the field of mental health care.</p>
        <div class="extended-content">
            <p>146 alumni attended the panel discussion at the Ian Potter Auditorium in the Parkville campus’ Kenneth Myer Building, with more than 1200 alumni registering to watch the discussion online.</p>
            <p>Panel moderator and ABC journalist Natasha Mitchell kicked off the session by polling the audience. She asked, “Do you feel confident or apprehensive about a future where artificial intelligence and machine learning plays a role in delivering mental health support services?”

                The poll was almost split evenly, with 49% of alumni responding ‘confident’ and 51% ‘apprehensive’ through a link on their smartphones.
                
                With such a divided response, the expert panellists were eager to share their knowledge on what the intersection of AI and mental health care looks like now and into the future.</p>
